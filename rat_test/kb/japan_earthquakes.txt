        Japan experiences frequent earthquakes because it is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire.
        The country sits on top of four major tectonic plates: the Pacific, Philippine Sea, 
        Eurasian, and North American plates. The movement and collision of these plates leads
        to frequent seismic activity.
