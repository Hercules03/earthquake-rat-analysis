                Japan Earthquakes: Facts and Information
                
                Japan experiences about 1,500 earthquakes every year. The country lies in a zone where several tectonic plates meet, making it one of the most seismically active areas in the world.
                
                Major tectonic plates affecting Japan:
                - Pacific Plate
                - Philippine Sea Plate
                - Eurasian Plate
                - North American Plate
                
                The movement and collision of these plates lead to frequent earthquakes. The Japan Trench, where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate, is particularly active.
